# Domestiq üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
*Your Cycling Recovery Companion - Helper of the Yellow Jersey*

## Overview

Domestiq is a cycling-focused recovery and training load management app designed to help cyclists optimize their performance through intelligent recovery tracking. Like a domestique supports the team leader, Domestiq supports your cycling journey by monitoring your recovery status and providing actionable insights for better training decisions.

## The Problem We Solve

Modern cyclists generate tons of data (power, heart rate, sleep, HRV) but struggle to:
- **Understand their daily readiness** to train hard vs recover
- **Interpret complex metrics** like TSS, CTL, ATL in practical terms
- **Connect sleep and recovery data** with their cycling performance
- **Make informed training decisions** based on their current state
- **Avoid overtraining** and optimize adaptation

## Core Philosophy

**Simple. Actionable. Cycling-Specific.**

- **Minimal UI** - Critical info at a glance, no overwhelming dashboards
- **Power-Based Recovery** - Uses cycling-specific metrics (TSS, power curve analysis)
- **Apple Health Integration** - Seamless sleep and HRV data from Apple Watch
- **Practical Recommendations** - "Should I go hard today?" gets a clear answer

## Tech Stack
